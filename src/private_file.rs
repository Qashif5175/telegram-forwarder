//! Writing a file that only its owner can read.
//!
//! Both files this tool persists hold something that should not be readable by
//! other users of the machine: the session file *is* a login to the Telegram
//! account, and the configuration holds the API credentials. They are written
//! through here so the answer is the same for both, rather than the session
//! being careful and the configuration inheriting whatever the umask allows.
//!
//! The permissions are applied *as the file is created*, not afterwards. A
//! create-then-`chmod` leaves the contents on disk at the umask's discretion for
//! as long as the write takes, which is precisely the window worth closing.
//!
//! On platforms without Unix permissions this is an ordinary write: Windows
//! inherits the containing directory's ACL, and the directories this tool
//! creates are under the user's own profile.
//!
//! Every entry point unlinks the target first. `OpenOptions::mode` applies only
//! when the file is *created*, so writing over one that already exists would
//! silently keep whatever mode it had — and both callers write to a fixed
//! temporary name, which a killed process can leave behind.
